Well, my love is an animal call
Cutting through the darkness, bouncing off the walls
Between teeth on a broken jaw
Following a blood trail, frothing at the maw (var)
These days I'm a circuit board
Integrated hardware you cannot afford
The perfect start to a perfect war (var)
Putting down the roses picking up the sword
