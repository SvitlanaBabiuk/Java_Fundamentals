I started my career in brand management about 20 years ago in California, after getting my MBA from
Stanford. I also have a B.A. in business from UCLA. I bounced around for a bit and had really good
opportunities to travel and build some wonderful teams. Then about six years ago I moved back to the
Midwest. I joined a startup, a really scrappy organization, and this time I had far more responsibility
for product development. I’m good at making things work better, putting strategies together, and leading
teams. I’m ready to take my leadership to the next level—maybe a chief marketing officer role—where
I can have a significant impact on the business.
