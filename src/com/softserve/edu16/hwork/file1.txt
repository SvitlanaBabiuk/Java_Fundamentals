After finishing school, I entered the Borys Grinchenko University in Kyiv to study journalism. 
I started working in my second year. I was completing an online order at a supermarket. 
Then I worked at the information agency Ukrinform for two years.
I worked as a correspondent. I wrote reports and news.
After a year I was transferred to the position of observer.
Now I want to try something new, so I started learning Java.
